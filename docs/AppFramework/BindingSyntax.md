# The *Unnamed* application framework documentation
## Binding syntax
The *Unnamed* framework offers a custom binding syntax. This is a syntax that you can use if the regular data-bind bindings become unmaintainable long. The syntax does not get in the way if you do not use it.

Regular data-bind syntax may become cumbersome if you have many bindings to apply to an element. Either the attribute gets very long:

    data-bind="visible: myBoolean, text: myText, if: myCondition() ? test1() : test2()"

Or you can spread it over multiple lines:

    data-bind="
		visible: myBoolean, 
		text: myText, 
		if: myCondition() ? test1() : test2()"

But the above syntax does not feel very "HTML". The syntax offered by this framework allows writing your bindings in a different way.

### General syntax
The general syntax is as follows:

    <element ko-binding="value" />

Which is equivalent to:

    <element data-bind="binding: value" />

### Camel-case binding handlers
Some binding handlers use camel-case names, for instance `textInput`. Since HTML attributes are case-insensitive, these binding handlers cannot be read as-is. Instead, use lowercase names and a dash before the uppercase character to represent the binding.

For example `ko-text-input` instead of `ko-textInput`.

### Sub properties
You can also express nested object expressions in the property bindings.

Express the below:

    data-bind="tooltip: { options: { position: 'top', forceOpen: true }, text: myObservable() }"

As:

    ko-tooltip:options:position="'top'"
    ko-tooltip:options:force-open="true"
    ko-tooltip:text="myObservable()"

As you can see, the `force-open` is translated to the camel-case `forceOpen`. 

#### Escaping 
In some cases you want to preserve the property name, for instance when binding to CSS:

    data-bind="css: { 'is-required': true }"

In that case you can use an asterisk (`*`) to escape the property name:

    ko-css-*is-required="true"

### String literals
It is odd to needing to put a string literal in additional quotes:

    ko-tooltip="'My tooltip'"

In that case you can use the hashbang mark to escape the property:

    ko-tooltip#="My tooltip"

This also works for nested properties:

    ko-tooltip:text#="My tooltip"
