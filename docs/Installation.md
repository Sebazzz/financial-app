# Financial App installation guide

This guide will help you in installation of the application. The application is a ASP.NET Core web application and will in the basis only require a SQL Server database server to get up and running.

**Note:** This installation guide covers very basic installation, just enough to get the application up and running. It does _not_ cover installation of the application as a systemd or Windows Service, nor setting it up behind any reverse proxy. Please refer to [hosting as a Windows service](https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/aspnet/core/hosting/windows-service), [hosting in Windows IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/aspnet/core/publishing/iis?tabs=aspnetcore2x) or [hosting on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/aspnet/core/publishing/linuxproduction?tabs=aspnetcore2x) pages on the official Microsoft docs for more information.

## Installation

You can configure the application via environment variables or configuration files. Environment variables are more update-friendly. The configurations shown below are environment variables (you can set them in bash by `export NAME=VALUE` and in Powershell via `$ENV:NAME = "VALUE"`).

### General configuration

`SERVER__BASEURL`: Base URL used for mailing. If not set, auto-detection is attempted.

### HTTPS configuration

To use HTTPs, use the following environment variables:

`SERVER__HTTPS__CERTIFICATEPATH`: Path to pfx file.

`SERVER__HTTPS__CERTIFICATEPASSWORD`: Password for pfx file.

The server will automatically start on port 80 and 443.

### Logging configuration

`LOGGING__FILE__PATH`: Path to log file.

`LOGGING__FILE__FILESIZELIMITBYTES`: Maximum size of log file in bytes. 0 for unlimited.

`DATABASE__CONNECTIONSTRING`: Connection string used to connection to the database. Usually: `Server=myserver;Integrated Security=true;Database=mydatabase;MultipleActiveResultSets=true`. Please ensure that `MultipleActiveResultSets=true` is present in the connection string.

### Application installation

Unpack the application on any location, for instance `/opt/fa-app`.

Modify the connection string in `launch.conf`.

You can try out the application using:

    ./launch run

Install the application as a systemd service using:

    ./launch install

View other options:

    ./launch --help

### Run

To run the application after installation, simply run:

    ./launch start

The application will launch at the URL specified in `launch.conf`.

You will be greeted with a setup wizard, in which you will be able to set-up an administrator user.
